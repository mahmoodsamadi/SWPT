# SWPT

Sub-watershed prioritization tool (SWPT) is an automated and user-friendly extension which allows to assess the prioritization of sub-watersheds and recognizes critical ones. It deals with morphometric and topo-hydrological factors and automatically produces them based on digital elevation model (DEM). This tool helps decision makers to identify critical sub-watersheds for planning soil and water conservation measures.
